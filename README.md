Project 3 - Data Visualisation 

### Project Title: 
Mapping Cancer: Exploring Cancer Prevalence in Canada

### Group 8 Team Members: 
Abeda Salsabil, John Geng, Sumaiya Nathani, 

### Project Description/Outline: 
The aim of our project is to analyze cancer prevalence in Canada by examining demographic and geographic patterns, temporal trends, and potential risk factors, and presenting our findings with interactive visualization tools. Overall, Our project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of cancer prevalence in Canada, with the goal of identifying potential areas for further research and intervention to reduce the burden of cancer in Canada. By using interactive visualization tools, we hope to enhance the accessibility and impact of our findings.

### Research Questions to Answer:
- What are the top 10 most prevalent cancers in Canada in the past 25 years?
- What provinces have the highest prevalence of cancer in Canada and what are the potential reasons for the difference in prevalence compared to other provinces? (can refer to this article for explanations) 
- What are the differences in cancer incidence rates between males and females in Canada, and how have these differences changed over time?
