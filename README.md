### Summary
**Project 3 - Data Visualisation**

  * **Project Title**: Mapping Cancer: Exploring Cancer Prevalence in Canada
  * **Group Team Members**: 
    * Abeda Salsabil
    * Sumaiya Nathani
    * Tuan Minh Bui

### Project Description: 
* The aim of our project is to analyze cancer prevalence in Canada by examining demographic and geographic patterns, temporal trends, and potential risk factors, and presenting our findings with interactive visualization tools. 
* Overall, Our project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of cancer prevalence in Canada, with the goal of identifying potential areas for further research and intervention to reduce the burden of cancer in Canada. By using interactive visualization tools, we hope to enhance the accessibility and impact of our findings.
